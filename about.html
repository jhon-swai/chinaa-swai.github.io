<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Chinaa A Swai born and raised in Tanzania. I have been always curious and open to different opportunities my whole life. During my primary education I did a lot of extra curricular activities that kept me busy for most of my free time. I played drums, football, basketball, dance music and swimming. When I went to secondary school football and religious activities kept me busy. Years passed very fast, before long I was done with O-level studies. At this point time was moving as slow as a tortoise and there wasn&rsquo;t much to do. This is when I was introduced to programming by a family friend and a few websites for starters. I started online free classes such as Khanacademy, codecademy and many more. I fell in love with this new art of creating and problem solving. I went tutorial after tutorial doing different coding challenges. I learnt a lot and grew so much.</p>

<p>The biggest drawback to my progress was that I lacked a mentor to guide me and show me the best path for my future I was also isolated completely from coding and my tutorials when I went to A-level secondary school since I was in a boarding school. I had to wait until the next holiday for me to continue. </p>

<p>Honestly my dream was never being a programmer but rather some business person, an electrical engineer or some other field. I took programming as a hobby until the day I had to choose what to study at the university level. I had to sit down and think about my career and future position. This made me realise that I can still take something I like and eventually work for something I am really passionate about and so I chose a Bsc. in computer engineering and IT. Programming is not just a career path that I happened to choose by accident but rather my passion. Coding gives me a voice and the ability to make an impact in the society. It gives me superpowers to make the world a better place and that is why I push myself beyond my limits and my comfort zone to learn new things all the time. I embrace every opportunity that comes in my way. </p>

<p>I am not coming from wealthy family nor is it well educated. Everyone is looking up to me to attain great achievements. My family has great hopes that one day I will be able to live the life they could not. That my children will be able to live the life they could not offer it to me. I work hard day and night to not let any of them down. </p>
